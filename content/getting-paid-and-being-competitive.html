        <h1>Getting paid and being competitive</h1>
    </header>
    <div class="entry content rich-text eight columns">
        <p class="p1">Deciding how you ask to be paid should involve finding the right balance between security and competitiveness.</p>
        <p class="p1">Getting paid in advance and in sterling poses the lowest risk to your business, but it&#x2019;s also less competitive &#x2013; your customers won&#x2019;t always want or be able to do that.</p>
        <p class="p1">Longer payment terms in the currency of your customer&#x2019;s choice could be higher risk, but are more competitive. You need to negotiate with your customers and meet somewhere in the middle.</p>
        <p class="p1">UK Export Finance can suggest options for payment methods, credit insurance and export finance that are appropriate for your business. If finding these options in the private sector proves challenging, UKEF may be able to offer government-backed finance or insurance.&#xA0;<a href="http://www.greatbusiness.gov.uk/ukef/">Request a free consultation</a> from a UKEF export finance manager.</p>
        <p class="p1">Your local chamber of commerce can help you arrange secure international payment methods such as letters of credit, a service that can often work in combination with export finance or insurance.</p>
        <h2 class="p1"><strong>Credit insurance</strong></h2>
        <p class="p1">Credit insurance protects you against the risk of not being paid, or of not being able to recover the costs of fulfilling an export contract. This allows you to be more flexible on payment terms.</p>
        <p class="p1">Even when you take out insurance you should also</p>
        <ul class="ul1">
            <li class="li1">be aware of market conditions</li>
            <li class="li1">always agree acceptable payment terms and methods</li>
            <li class="li1"><a href="/find-out-if-a-potential-customer-is-creditworthy/">check the creditworthiness of potential customers</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="p1">Check the government&#x2019;s list of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-export-finance-insurance-list-of-approved-brokers/export-insurance-approved-brokers"><span class="s1">specialist credit insurance brokers</span></a> for export. They&#x2019;ve been approved by UK Export Finance in connection with its <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/export-insurance-policy"><span class="s1">export insurance policy</span></a>, which can provide coverage in higher risk markets that isn&#x2019;t available from commercial insurers.</p>
        <h2 class="p1"><strong>Use foreign exchange specialists</strong></h2>
        <p class="p1">Exchange rates rise and fall which can affect your profitability and cash flow. However, demanding payment in sterling at a fixed price is potentially uncompetitive.</p>
        <p class="p1">Foreign exchange specialists can help you to identify, qualify and manage the risks of exchange rate fluctuations. Some countries also have access restrictions in place for foreign currency, which can impact payment. In these cases, it&#x2019;s worth getting a confirmed, irrevocable Letter of Credit through a bank to secure payment according to the terms of credit at an agreed rate.</p>
        <p class="p3"><span class="s2">Check FX Compared&#x2019;s <a href="https://www.fxcompared.com/currency-volatility"><span class="s3">currency volatility tool</span></a></span> to assess how currency volatility may affect your transactions.</p>
        <h2 class="p1"><strong>Consider merchant services to get payments</strong></h2>
        <p class="p1">It&#x2019;s also important to think about how long it will take to get paid internationally and how the money will be put into your account. Merchant services specialists can help you with getting paid. They can advise and provide systems such as credit and debit card payment or online and point of sale payment.</p>
