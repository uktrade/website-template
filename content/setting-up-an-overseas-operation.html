        <h1>Setting up an overseas operation</h1>
    </header>

    <div class="entry content rich-text eight columns">
        <p>Most firms only set up an overseas operation after testing the market. This can be a logical progression from working with an agent or distributor as a company grows its sales.</p>
<p>The advantages can be attractive and include:</p>
<ul>
<li>lower costs</li>
<li>increased market penetration</li>
<li>a positive message to the local market</li>
<li>improved customer service</li>
</ul>
<p>Your operation may be owned by your existing company or can be set up with a different owner.</p>
<p>Remember that the learning curve on this route may be steep. Initial costs are likely to be high and there&#x2019;s more exposure to risk, such as legal liability. This can be offset to an extent by research and planning, and a thorough understanding of the country&#x2019;s legal and regulatory framework.</p>
<p>See our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/exporting-country-guides">exporting country guides</a> as a starting point.</p>
<p>Setting up an overseas operation involves some form of capital outlay and the main options are:</p>
<ul>
<li>a local representative office in the export market</li>
<li>a joint venture with a company local to the foreign market</li>
<li>acquisition of an existing company in the market</li>
<li>setting up a subsidiary of a parent UK company, or a standalone company</li>
</ul>
