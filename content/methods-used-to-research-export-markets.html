        <h1>Methods used to research export markets</h1>

    <div class="entry content rich-text eight columns">
        <p>There are two main strands to market research:</p>
<ul>
<li>desk research (gathering information from existing sources)</li>
<li>field research (visiting the potential market)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Desk research</h2>
<p>If you decide to do your desk research in-house, start by looking at our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/exporting-country-guides">exporting country guides</a>. You can find information on marketing, statistical and contact details for more than 100 countries and markets. Search through <a href="http://www.marketresearch.com">pre-published market research reports</a> and see industry analysis.</p>
<p>You might find Google&#x2019;s <a href="https://translate.google.com/globalmarketfinder?locale=en">Global Market Finder</a> a useful starting point. It&#x2019;s a free, online application that helps you find new markets for your products or services overseas. Search and compare keyword performance across the world and see where people are looking for your product or service.</p>
<p>Useful resources to look at include the <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/">CIA world factbook</a>, which gives information on the history, people, government, economy, geography, communications, transportation, military and transnational issues for 267 world entities.</p>
<p>Here is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)_per_capita">list of countries by GDP</a>. You&#x2019;ll find a lot of country and population data from the <a href="http://www.oecd.org/about/">Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development</a>. The <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/">World Bank</a> has statistics and data on agriculture and urban development.</p>
<p>Find <a href="http://www.taforum.org/">details of trade bodies</a> and a <a href="http://www.eventseye.com/">trade show directory</a> that lists events across the world. Search for suppliers across the world by industry, products or services.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.export.org.uk/about-us">Institute of Export</a> offers qualifications and training as well as supporting your exporting plans.</p>
<h2>Field research</h2>
<p>You can do this yourself by visiting your target location and setting up meetings with potential customers to gauge the level of demand for your product or service. There will be a cost implication to any field visit, so make sure you research your options for financing the trip before committing to it.</p>
<p>Consider contacting <a href="http://www.britishchambers.org.uk/">The British Chambers of Commerce</a> for practical business-to-business support, such as recommendations on agencies. Make use of their network, which represents business interests in Brussels, as well as in Westminster and across the rest of the UK.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.fsb.org.uk/">Federation of Small Businesses</a> also offers advice, financial expertise and other valuable support to its members.</p>
<p>If you decide to use a research agency, consider whether to use a UK-based organisation or an agency in the country you&#x2019;re researching. Our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/overseas-market-introduction-service">Overseas Market Introduction Service </a>can introduce you to local experts who can carry out research for you. These teams are based in British Embassies or within the British Chambers of Commerce network.</p>
<h2>Briefing a market research agency</h2>
<p>Once you&#x2019;ve selected the right agency for your business, you&#x2019;ll need to brief them. Your brief should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>a description of your company and what you want to export</li>
<li>the geographical scope</li>
<li>the reason for the research and the information you need</li>
<li>the deadline for the research</li>
<li>a description of how you want the report formatted and presented</li>
</ul>
<p>If the agency accepts your brief, their proposal should demonstrate a clear understanding of the project and your requirements, and should contain:</p>
<ul>
<li>how the research will be done and why</li>
<li>the background and qualifications of the researchers involved</li>
<li>a breakdown of costings, including all foreseeable expenses and fees</li>
<li>clear timescales, including the time allocated to each stage of the research</li>
<li>a confidentiality agreement</li>
</ul>
