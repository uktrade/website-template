        <h1>Clear goals for face-to-face meetings</h1>
    </header>

    <div class="entry content rich-text eight columns">
        <p>It&#x2019;s important to make sure you&#x2019;ve thought about clear goals for your face-to-face meetings as they will:</p>
<ul>
<li>feed into a potential agenda or checklist for both sides</li>
<li>reassure the person you&#x2019;re meeting as to what you&#x2019;re going to cover (this can help them to do any preparation they need to and select an appropriate interpreter, if necessary)</li>
<li>give a clear structure to your meeting</li>
<li>ensure you get the most out of your time and the best out of the person you&#x2019;re meeting with</li>
</ul>
<p>A face-to-face meeting can be as formal or informal as you want to make it and this will often depend on the place you&#x2019;re visiting and the person you&#x2019;re going to be talking to. However informal it is, though, knowing what you need to get out of the meeting will help you shape what happens and ensure its success.</p>
<p>Your goals will need to be tailored around the specifics of your particular business, but you could think about:</p>
<ul>
<li>whether you&#x2019;re just aiming to make contact, or are trying to get to a definite outcome or decision</li>
<li>whether it&#x2019;s just a general information-gathering exercise, or there are more detailed facts and figures you need from the person you&#x2019;re meeting</li>
<li>what you would need to get from the meeting to consider it a success &#x2013; increased sales, new leads, a better idea of the networks in the area</li>
<li>what you can achieve in person that you wouldn&#x2019;t be able to remotely, like being introduced to other key employees or partners, and seeing offices or warehouses or other locations</li>
</ul>
<p>To help you get started or increase your success in a new country, consider attending a <a href="http://www.events.ukti.gov.uk">trade mission</a> arranged either by DIT or another organisation, such as a trade association, the <a href="http://exportbritain.org.uk/events/">British Chambers of Commerce</a> or <a href="https://enterprisenation.com/blog/categories/international-trade">Enterprise Nation</a>. The missions take UK businesses on short trips to get on-the-ground experience of a particular country and its business culture and opportunities.</p>
