    <p>Exporting requires commitment and enthusiasm from staff across your company, not just top level management and sales. Consider how you&#x2019;ll communicate developments and spread enthusiasm across your business for exporting.</p>
    <p>Think about whether your company currently has the right management skills and expertise to develop and service export markets.</p>
    <p>You may need extra staff or at least extra staff time for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>market research</li>
      <li>international sales and marketing (consider what might make your marketing content, including your website, fit for purpose in a foreign market)</li>
      <li>business culture and language knowledge &#x2013; effective communication in a foreign language market will require at least a small amount of language skills</li>
      <li>finance, documentation and logistics</li>
      <li>finding and managing partners</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Remember that you can get support and services in many of these areas, some of it free or at a low cost, from partner organisations, your local Chambers of Commerce and international trade advisers in the Department for International Trade&#x2019;s regional network. Your staff might also benefit from the Institute of Export&#x2019;s <a href="http://www.export.org.uk/training">short courses</a> and other training related to trading overseas.</p>
    <p>Exporting is a process that needs to be planned. You&#x2019;ll require clear objectives and must be realistic for what your business can achieve within specific time periods. An export plan should be an essential part of this, whether separate or part of your existing business plan.</p>
