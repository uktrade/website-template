        <h1>Find out if a potential customer is creditworthy</h1>
    </header>

    <div class="entry content rich-text eight columns">
        <p>As with domestic customers, &#xA0;you need to be clear what the possibility is that you won&#x2019;t get paid. &#xA0;By checking your potential customers&#x2019; finances, you can make decisions on how much risk your business is prepared to take. &#xA0;This should be part of your market and business research.</p>
<p>If you&#x2019;re travelling to your new market, do try to visit potential customers, particularly if they are going to be of high value to your business.</p>
<p>UKEF, your bank or accountant, or companies like Experian can help you do international credit checks on customers.</p>
<p>Other ways to understand whether a customer is creditworthy include:</p>
<ul>
<li>ask them for a bank reference</li>
<li>check the country equivalents of Companies House if businesses are required to publish their accounts in that market</li>
<li>check their websites and get names of their suppliers and contact them directly or ask the customer if they have suppliers who are willing to give them a reference</li>
<li>talk to local Chambers of Commerce and the appropriate industry and country trade associations to see if they are aware of the customer</li>
<li>you can also agree to have the first few invoices paid immediately in full to build trust and then make a decision about future credit</li>
</ul>
<p>If you&#x2019;re still worried about getting paid, consider <a href="https://www.exportingisgreat.gov.uk/getting-paid-and-being-competitive/">getting credit insurance</a>.</p>
