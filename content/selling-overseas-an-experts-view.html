        <p>Research suggests that one in 3 exporters don&#x2019;t know which market to target. The best options to begin with are probably those that are closest to home and the ones where doing business is most similar to the UK. Ireland, Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark are all good markets as there are close links with the UK and English is the business language used. After that, other markets in Europe are a possibility, and then you could look to the Gulf as there are frequent daily flights to Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Bahrain, Qatar and other countries in that region.</p>
<p>The USA continues to be the UK&#x2019;s largest export market. When considering doing business in America it is important to be aware that while it offers huge potential it can also be a challenging market for new exporters. When you&#x2019;re ready you need to make a decision as to which part of the country will be your initial focus. It could be a city, state or even a region: the east coast, midwest, west coast. Using a small area of this huge market as a starter or pilot could prove the most successful strategy.</p>
