        <p>If you have a product or service that is performing well at home, then there will almost certainly be a demand for it overseas. The UK accounts for just 1/20th of the world&#x2019;s economy, so confining your business to the domestic market is overlooking a huge potential.</p>
<h2>Exporting spreads business risk</h2>
<p>There are many reasons why you might not be selling overseas. You might be satisfied with the level of sales you&#x2019;re making in the UK. Maybe you don&#x2019;t want to deal with the perceived hassle of regulations, paperwork and cultural barriers. You could think exporting is a risky venture in uncertain times. Or you might be interested but just don&#x2019;t know where to start.</p>
<p>Each of these is a misconception. Exporting actually reduces risk by spreading it across a wider range of customers and protecting your business if the UK demand for your product or services falls. Any business venture carries an element of risk and you&#x2019;ll need to weigh export opportunities carefully. But trading internationally, if you&#x2019;re being smart about it, adds more security than risk to your business.</p>
<p>And there are many reasons to export besides profit. Operating in new markets will mean you&#x2019;re more likely to be aware of emerging needs of that market and new opportunities that may arise. All of this exposure makes for a sharper UK business that&#x2019;s more innovative and better able to maintain a competitive position in your sector. Exporting also enhances your business&#x2019;s profile, whether for new clients at home or ones abroad.</p>
<p>Using our advice and guidance and by taking things step by step, you can more than manage the extra challenges of exporting and take advantage of the benefits, no matter what the size of your business. Our guidance makes it easier to understand regulations, shipping, local knowledge, language and cultural differences, getting paid and much more. Our services will help you find new markets and new opportunities and take advantage of the benefits of selling online.</p>
<p>You don&#x2019;t have to go it alone &#x2013; and with a little determination you&#x2019;ll soon bring new profits, added security and a higher profile to your business.</p>
