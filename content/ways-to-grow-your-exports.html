        <h1>Ways to grow your exports</h1>
    </header>

    <div class="entry content rich-text eight columns">
        <p>There are lots of ways you can grow your export business. Here are just 3 that you should consider.</p>
<h2>Breaking into new markets</h2>
<p>You&#x2019;re probably aware that emerging and &#x2018;high growth&#x2019; markets can present huge opportunities, but sometimes also equally high levels of risk. The Middle East, Southeast Asia, Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa are all regions with enormous potential.</p>
<p>While you may already have capable staff or an agency handling your market research in certain countries, some top-level research of your own could help you think about your global strategic approach. Here are a few impartial and authoritative indices that can help evaluate the overall suitability of a market for export, even before you factor in demand for your product:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Data">International Monetary Fund&#x2019;s data</a> includes growth forecasts for countries</li>
<li>the World Bank&#x2019;s <a href="http://www.doingbusiness.org/rankings/">Ease of doing business index</a> highlights countries that are making business easier with less bureaucracy and &#x2018;red tape&#x2019;</li>
<li>the annual <a href="http://www.transparency.org/research/cpi/overview">Corruption Perceptions Index</a> ranks countries by perceived levels of corruption</li>
</ul>
<p>Preliminary <a href="https://www.exportingisgreat.gov.uk/research-your-market/">market research</a> can involve a combination of these tools alongside ones like Google&#x2019;s <a href="https://translate.google.com/globalmarketfinder">Global Market Finder</a> and the Department for International Trade&#x2019;s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/exporting-country-guides">exporting country guides</a>. These can help you assemble a shortlist of potential countries for exporting your product or service. Then you can bring your team or agency in to conduct further research and begin your export plan.</p>
<h2>Opening a regional office</h2>
<p>The success of your export business can sometimes mean adapting what&#x2019;s been a winning formula in the past. Your operating model may have previously involved a local agent or distributor, but once your exports have reached a certain level, it may be beyond the expertise of the local agent or distributor to continue to grow your business. For this reason many companies decide to open a regional office.</p>
<p>One of the first big questions around opening a regional office is where you should set up shop. There are many considerations, such as transport hubs, infrastructure, good communications and the cost and ease of setting up an office. The most popular strategic locations in the Gulf, for example, are Dubai and Abu Dhabi. In Southeast Asia many businesses locate in Singapore or Hong Kong. In the USA there is more choice depending on the sales focus, but New York, Miami and Los Angeles are often good starting points.</p>
<p>You&#x2019;ll want to take advantage of local expertise, hiring people with the relevant language skills, local knowledge and professional understanding of that country&#x2019;s regulatory environment.</p>
<p>Our international trade advisors have insights into the process and can share advice on opening an office. There are also websites for most markets that can assist you, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select USA, which offers a range of <a href="https://www.selectusa.gov/online-tools-and-resources">online tools and resources</a> for operating in America</li>
<li>InvestHK, which has resources for <a href="http://www.investhk.gov.hk/index.html">opening an office in Hong Kong</a></li>
<li>Future Ready Singapore, which has a guide to Starting a Business in Singapore</li>
<li>the website of the <a href="http://www.dubaided.ae/English/Pages/default.aspx">Dubai Department of Economic Development</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Developing existing markets</h2>
<p>You&#x2019;ll often see bigger and quicker returns if you focus on expanding within an existing market rather than trying a new one. It&#x2019;s worth considering if there is scope in your current market to open a new office, distribution warehouse, or manufacturing unit.</p>
<p>Relationships in your target market are just as important as bricks and mortar. A partnership with a local company, for example, whose expertise and interests pair with yours, can be mutually beneficial. It could also lead to a strategic alliance, joint venture or even eventual acquisition of that business.</p>
<p>Investing the time in the market to build closer relationships with export customers is also an important objective. In a business environment dominated by email and Skype, the importance of face-to-face communications and market visits shouldn&#x2019;t be overlooked.</p>
