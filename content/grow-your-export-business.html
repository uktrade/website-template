    <h1>Grow your export business</h1>
  </header>
  <div class="entry content rich-text eight columns">
    <p>Increasing exports can mean bigger returns on your investments and help to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>increase brand recognition for your services or products</li>
      <li>spread risk across a wider range of customers and protect your business if UK demand falls</li>
      <li>enhance your reputation in the markets where you operate</li>
      <li>attract new clients and customers</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You may not be a stranger to export, but if it&#x2019;s not yet a key feature of your business it should be.</p>
    <h2>Use your current market as a springboard</h2>
    <p>If you&#x2019;re currently established in one country overseas, consider how the knowledge and experience you&#x2019;ve gained there might be useful in another market with similar culture, languages or demographics. For example, successful operations in Spain will encounter less of a language barrier in Mexico or Argentina than in, say, Brazil. Geographic factors such as climate or proximity can also make jumps from one market to another easier. If you&#x2019;re doing business in Dubai, for example, expanding into Abu Dhabi, Qatar or Bahrain isn&#x2019;t a huge step.</p>
    <p>Thorough research on cultural differences and customer demand is really important to properly assess the suitability of expanding into a new, albeit similar, market. There are impartial and authoritative indices that can help evaluate the overall suitability of a market for export, even before you factor in demand for your product:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>the <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Data">International Monetary Fund&#x2019;s data</a>, which includes growth forecasts for countries</li>
      <li>the World Bank&#x2019;s <a href="http://www.doingbusiness.org/rankings/">Ease of doing business index</a>, which highlights countries that are making business easier with less bureaucracy and &#x2018;red tape&#x2019;</li>
      <li>the annual <a href="http://www.transparency.org/research/cpi/overview">Corruption Perceptions Index</a>, which ranks countries by perceived levels of corruption</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Google&#x2019;s Global Market Finder and the Department for International Trade&#x2019;s exporting country guides can also assist your research.</p>
    <h2>Look for more than just buyers</h2>
    <p>While your end goal as an exporter may be sales, it&#x2019;s important to avoid focusing solely on the buyer as your motivator. For less experienced exporters, who you know can be as important as what you know. Having a good network allows you to profit from the experience of others, so that you avoid unnecessary pitfalls. You&#x2019;ll also gain local trust, something that is often more valuable than a single sale.</p>
    <p>Establishing business relationships first-hand also means you&#x2019;re more likely to hear about opportunities for sales or collaborative ventures. Being active in a good business network in your market also gives you unique insights into research, development and local sources of funding. You might even find an investor in your UK business.</p>
