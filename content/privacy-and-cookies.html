	<p><strong>How the DIT protects your personal information</strong></p>
	<p>The DIT complies with the Data Protection Act 1998.</p>
	<p>The DIT will:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>tell you why the information is needed. For example, we ask about your company&#x2019;s exporting experience to decide whether it is suitable for inclusion in the Find a Buyer service</li>
		<li>only ask for what&#x2019;s needed</li>
		<li>make sure nobody has access to it who shouldn&#x2019;t</li>
		<li>tell you if the information is shared with other organisations and if you can say no to this</li>
		<li>only keep the information for as long as it&#x2019;s needed</li>
		<li>not make it available for commercial use (for example, for marketing) without your permission</li>
	</ul>
	<p>You must:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>give accurate information</li>
		<li>tell the DIT about any changes, for example, to your address</li>
	</ul>
	<p><strong>Sharing your information</strong></p>
	<p>Your information can be shared with other teams in the DIT or other organisations where this is needed to process your application.</p>
	<p>There are some cases when your information can be shared for other reasons, for example, to prevent crime.</p>
	<p>If you&#x2019;re asking for information that isn&#x2019;t published on www.GREAT.gov.uk, DIT may need to contact other organisations to find answers to your questions.</p>
	<p>If your question is technical, DIT may need to pass information to technology suppliers. DIT will only pass on personal data if it is necessary to do so, and will not keep your personal data or records of its correspondence longer than necessary.</p>
