        <h1>York bag retailer goes global via e-commerce</h1>
    </header>

    <div class="entry content rich-text eight columns">
        <p>York-based retailer <a href="http://www.maxwellscottbags.com/">Maxwell Scott Bags</a> was already selling internationally from its UK website when its owners made the decision to launch a German website. They&#x2019;d noticed an increase in orders from Germany and went on to launch both a German and US site in 2013.</p>
<p>Exporting overseas has seen the business grow by 300% in 3 years and led to the appointment of a Head of e-Marketplaces who focuses on expanding their business further in the online world.</p>
<p>The business got further help and advice from an e-commerce adviser at DIT, who provided recommendations for global online marketplaces to sell through. They now make 25% of total export sales through Amazon, and factor these into their e-commerce expansion plans.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Working with Amazon has allowed us to save money on buying our own warehouses and additional manpower, and focus on growing other areas of the business,&#x201D; says founder William Forshaw.</p>
