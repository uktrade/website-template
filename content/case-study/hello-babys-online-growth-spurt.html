        <p><a href="https://www.hellobabydirect.com/">Hello Baby</a> is an online nursery business that gets more than half its profits from exporting through online marketplaces such as Amazon, eBay and CDiscount. The company uses these platforms to sell its wide range of baby products &#x2013; such as prams, car seats and nursery furniture &#x2013; to an expanding customer base in the United States, Europe, Australia, Japan and Canada.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Online marketplaces provide the easiest solution for us to grow internationally,&#x201D; says founder Trevor Ginn. &#x201C;They also help us to sell a lot of products, quickly and easily.&#x201D; He singles out Amazon&#x2019;s FBA EFN feature (Fulfillment by Amazon European Fulfillment Network) as particularly helpful when selling to Amazon&#x2019;s customer base in the EU: &#x201C;We ship the items to Amazon&#x2019;s warehouse and they do the rest &#x2013; easy!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Hello Baby&#x2019;s initial foray into online marketplaces was made easier thanks to help from DIT&#x2019;s E-Exporting Programme. &#x201C;We started to face a few barriers, such as certain online marketplaces needing us set up a local bank account,&#x201D; he explains. &#x201C;But DIT put us in touch with a company who helped us to navigate this process.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The department also helped Hello Baby by introducing the business to important contacts at online marketplaces, making deals on their behalf and helping them solve initial problems in growing their business online. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s not always clear as a UK retailer how to sell on international e-marketplaces, but DIT helped us each step of the way,&#x201D; says Ginn. &#x201C;If we didn&#x2019;t export online, we wouldn&#x2019;t have a business.&#x201D;</p>
