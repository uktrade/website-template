        <h1>Online marketplaces propel FreestyleXtreme</h1>
    </header>

    <div class="entry content rich-text eight columns">
        <p>Like many businesses, Bristol-based specialist sports retailer <a href="http://www.freestylextreme.com/uk/default.aspx">FreestyleXtreme</a>&#xA0;has seen big growth through online sales overseas. They started out selling online in 2012 through eBay, then grew by launching on eBay stores globally through the cross-border programme. They then further expanded on all Amazon&#x2019;s markets.</p>
<p>But it was online marketplaces that really helped their exports take off and make them into the thriving business they are today: FreestyleXtreme now have a projected annual turnover of &#xA3;10 million.</p>
<p>Sales went from 0 to 1,000 NZD within a few days of listing on the New Zealand based TradeMe online marketplace platform. And it&#x2019;s been a similar story on French online marketplaces La Redoute and Cdiscount, who are now generating more sales for FreestyleXtreme than Amazon France.</p>
<p>FreestyleXtreme also had some assistance from the Department for International Trade (DIT), who helped them&#xA0;set up a local cooperative to reduce international shipping costs. &#x2018;Parcel Rate Experts&#x2019; brought together local online retailers to get competitive rates and solve one of the main barriers to exporting.</p>
<p>&#x201C;My advice to brands is to try these e-marketplaces,&#x201D; says founder Shaun Loughlin. &#x201C;Because nobody could have convinced me of the success we are having now.&#x201D;</p>
