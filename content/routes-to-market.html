        <h1>Routes to market</h1>
    </header>

    <div class="entry content rich-text eight columns">
        <p>There are 4 main ways to sell your product or service overseas:</p>
<ul>
<li>selling through agents and distributors</li>
<li>selling direct</li>
<li>contractual methods such as licensing or franchising</li>
<li>setting up an overseas operation</li>
</ul>
<p>To find out the best route for your business, be prepared to research and get advice on what&#x2019;s already happening in your target market. You&#x2019;ll need to determine, for example, where customers are currently buying from and whether it&#x2019;s the norm to have local representation, such as a distributor. It&#x2019;s also important to take steps to protect your intellectual property, regardless of which way you choose to export.</p>
<p>Some routes to market will need higher levels of initial investment and more ongoing management, and may not be suitable if you&#x2019;re new to export. But if you are in a position to invest more effort and resource then you&#x2019;re likely to see some rewards. It might be a good idea to test more than one method of selling on a smaller scale before settling on a route.</p>

<h3>Using local agents or distributors in other countries</h3>
<p>Local representation can be a quick and effective way to enter a new overseas market. An agent or a distributor will understand the business culture and should have existing contacts to open the doors to new export orders.</p>
<p>An agent negotiates sales on your behalf so your product or service is delivered directly to the customer. The agent is simply identifying and &#x2018;warming&#x2019; up the customer in return for an agreed commission. Using an agent can be a cost-effective choice as the right one will:</p>
<ul>
<li>know the market</li>
<li>communicate regularly with you</li>
<li>help to overcome language issues</li>
<li>already be working with potential customers</li>
</ul>
<p>Distributors buy products from you and then sell to their customers. You invoice the distributor who holds the stock, adds a markup and sells to the end customer. A good distributor will:</p>
<ul>
<li>understand your overseas market and legal issues</li>
<li>bear the currency risk</li>
<li>provide warehousing</li>
<li>provide local after-sales support</li>
</ul>
<h3>Finding and working with agents and distributors</h3>
<p>Agents and distributors will usually ask for an exclusive arrangement with you in a given market, so it&#x2019;s a good idea to have a trial period with them in a small geographic area. In a very large country, such as the USA, China or India, be aware that one agent is unlikely to have the capacity to cover more than a part of the country. Always be specific in making any agreements &#x2013; for example identify which countries are covered rather than referring to regions such as the Middle East.</p>
<p>Relationships with agents and distributors can be difficult to get out of in some countries. It pays to take time to choose a suitable one. Get listings and recommendations from:</p>
<ul>
<li>other companies operating in the same sector</li>
<li>contacts at trade fairs and exhibitions</li>
<li>UK trade associations as well as overseas ones</li>
<li>the Department for International Trade&#x2019;s trade adviser network</li>
</ul>
