        <h1>Selling direct to customers overseas</h1>
    </header>

    <div class="entry content rich-text eight columns">
        <p>Selling direct can require a greater commitment of time, resource and finance than other routes to market. However, your rewards can be greater too. You&#x2019;ll most likely have more:</p>
<ul>
<li>control over how you operate in your chosen countries</li>
<li>engagement with your customer</li>
<li>awareness of your competitors&#x2019; activities</li>
</ul>
<p>You&#x2019;ll need to think about dedicating one or more members of staff to travelling to a new market, delivering your service and representing your products to new contacts. It may be essential for them to speak the language, understand the business culture and have relevant experience to gain respect from the potential client or customer.</p>
<p>Another effective method of selling directly to customers is via online channels &#x2013; websites, social media and online marketplaces. This can be an easier, lower cost option for smaller companies and new exporters.</p>

<h2>Licensing and franchising products or services abroad</h2>
<p>Export licensing involves granting to another person or business the right to provide your service or sell your product. This is typically done in return for an upfront payment and royalties based on sales.</p>
<p>Licensing is more commonly used by companies with new products or services who are looking for a swift launch in international markets. It lets a company take a product to market without the expense and risks involved in setting up locally. There can be a considerable initial cost and you&#x2019;ll need legal support to ensure agreements are worded and carried out correctly.</p>
<p>Franchising is a form of licensing and is suited to companies with a well-developed business model. It&#x2019;s particularly popular in the USA. It makes for fast expansion of a brand through franchise holders, with little capital investment and a low penalty for failure. Returns may be lower compared to more traditional routes, however, and you&#x2019;ll need to consider ways of maintaining quality control.</p>
<p>As a licensee you&#x2019;ll need intellectual property protection in the overseas markets you are targeting. Be aware that the licensing route is not a popular or recognised method in some markets: take advice on whether your company and target markets are suited to this approach.</p>
